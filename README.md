# Facial Detection, Recognition and Emotion Detection #
## Introduction ##
### [face_recog.py](https://github.com/rainarit/FacialReg/blob/master/face_recog.py) ###
This script detects all the faces from a video capture in real time. Using the Haar Cascade Classifier, the script is able to process each frame of the video and detect any faces. With the use of the `facial_recognition` library, the script can verify faces and recognize if two faces match. The `facial_recognition` library compares the detected face to an inputted facial image and returns the result in a TTS(Text-To-Voice) format, hence welcoming the person. 
### [emotion_recog.py](https://github.com/rainarit/FacialReg/blob/master/emotion_recog.py) ###
In Progress :soon:
